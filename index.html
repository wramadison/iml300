      <p>My project is still a work in progress since I changed my topic a bit, but it's called "Smile for the Camera". I like to think of it as both a small photo album documentary of my life through various random photos, as well as my rather rocky relationship with photos and cameras and how I, being someone who hates being photographed or recorded, ironically fell in love with being on the other side of the camera. The journey of the story talks about the different types of pictures my family have taken of me and treasure, from baby photos, to pictures with fake smiles, to performance photos, to candid shots. As I explain the types of photos as well as the specific examples I use, I wanted the user to get a better understanding of my relationship with cameras.</p>

    <h1>Thoughts:</h1>
<h2> Week 1:</h2>
      <p>“Cataloguing Change: Women, Art and Technology” serves as a record of the contributions of women in technology-based art as the medium has developed over centuries. As technology and the affairs of computers and the conversations around them (especially during the times of conception surrounding technological inventions and innovations) have and are currently still widely male-dominated, I actually found the amount of examples of influential women in computer-based art and technology, dating all the way back to the 19th century with mathematician and leading computer programmer Ada Lovelace, to be eye-opening. It puts into perspective the importance of uplifting the work women in male-dominated contribute to our society, as marginalized communities very often tend to be erased from history literally or conceptually. </br> </br>Questions: How do we more properly acknowledge the contributions of marginalized groups, particularly women, in industries that conceptually reject and silence them?How do the ever-changing and fluid aspects of society and culture inform art, and where computers play a role in expressing that art?How do/will the gendered expectations of women in arts and humanities and men in STEM fare in a world where STEM, arts and humanities become more connected and intertwined than ever?</p>
<h2>Week 3:</h2>
 <p> "Black Gooey Universe" and its comparison between the transition from black to white screens in technology as time passes and the rising/constant undertone of anti-blackness and racism within technology and society was very surprising to me. Although the literal connection between the two seems outlandish, the connection between a lack of representation innovative technologies and spaces in Silicon Valley can be felt in many of the types of technology nowadays that have biometric features. Many technological features that require documenting or photographing features of their subjects simply aren't properly programmed to properly document (or even acknowledge) the existence of dark skin, which could cause immense problems in automation in the near future. </br> </br>Questions: How can companies in Silicon Valley and other hubs of innovative technologies integrate the important of equitable acknowledgement and representation in future technology?
Is the connection between the development of the white screen that overtook the black screen and the erasure of the struggles and problems of Black people in society really outlandish, or is it a proper analogy?
Has technology already been too far colonized by white cis male populations largely considered leaders within technology, or is it possible to integrate more diversity within these leaders in technology as it advances?</p>
 <h2>Week 4:</h2>
 <p>I enjoyed both the historical/practical and interpretive/subjective aspects of the recorded lecture and the article respectively. While the lecture tackles understanding the Internet as a cloud of interconnectivity that runs theoretically and literally around the world along with its historical context in being created to decentralize information in the way it has today, the article takes more of an intrinsic and existential look on how one fits into the scope of the cloud of the Internet. Understanding both the foundations and reasonings of creating the Internet, along with how they're used on personal, capitalistic, governmental, and worldwide level is extremely important in order to be an informed user of the Internet. In that sense, understanding the power and dangers of being able to control a narrative or control information in the sort of manufactured vacuum that the Internet and social media creates is also crucial to understanding the way the Internet works, grows, and evolves.</br> </br> Questions: How can we, as users of the Internet, gain and keep more control of our narratives on the Internet if that all? How has the intended decentralized nature of the Internet affected the transfer of information and disinformation over time? Are there ways we can more easily grasp with the evolution of the Internet and how information is convey and on what Internet forms, or is it all a part of the necessary rough transitions of culture and society?</p>
 <h2> Week 6:</h2>
 <p> A large component of Lauren lee McCarthy’s “Feeling at Home” involves discussing and experimenting with that which makes us feel uncomfortable, ye attracts us at the same time. At first, the theme in question was the concept of attention or being followed; although many of us would find the idea of non-consensually being followed or stalked without our knowledge to be an invasion of privacy and breach of personal space, the idea of being aware of being followed, looked at, and, in a more introspective way, understood, intrigues a great amount of us. I find this work of breaking the boundaries of discomfort, nature, and desire to be extremely interesting, as I found my own personal experience with it; although the examples of physically following someone around (even with their permission), taking one’s DNA to map out a digital representation of their face, and a person watching you and having control of your home scared and repelled me, I thought of all the aspects in which I engage with AI or technology that follows those same functions, and how I’m more okay with it.
</br> </br>
Questions:
 
Could finding ways to humanize AI be beneficial to intelligence-assisted programs, if at all possible?
 
Where does the line of comfort lie in wanting to be followed, and how has that widely changed over time?
 
How can technology and community become more intertwined when much of technology is fueled behind capitalism, which thrives on competition and individualism?</p>
 
 <h2> Week 7:</h2>
 <p>“In Defense of the Poor Image” takes a critical look into the classist origins in the divide between cinema/fine art and “poor images” such as memes or home videos, which serve different purposes and are marketed in different ways. While high images are often privatized and hardly touchable, giving them a solid sense of agency in their messages and marketing, poor images in shared spaces like social media or YouTube allow an infinite amount of people to interpret and utilize images for a multitude of reasons, leaving the poor image with whatever meaning it is given in the moment instead of its potential original meaning. This analysis of the high and poor image as reflections of high and low culture with many of the same criteria (proximity, appearance and audience) allow us to see the impact that low resolution photos or photos we may not know the origins of can have on society. 
</br> </br>
Questions: How should we feel about the poor image’s loss of original intent and applied intents being substituted for it?

Will the privatization of media catch up to the velocity that poor images move at?

Is high resolution the answer to every image?</p>
 <h2> Week 8</h2>
 <p> Joy Buolamwini's Ted Talk is an eye-opening look into how humanity's pitfalls can seep into the seemingly flawless and objective world of computers. Discussing algorithmic bias as well as the accelerated use of algorithms as a form of violating privacy and assessing future probabilities, Joy's speech on how dangerous the future of a computer-run society without an accurate or fair representation of the society they would function was very telling. It's so interesting how improving our society via representation in STEM spaces is such a pivotal part of our world of technology.
</br> </br>
Questions: 

Can algorithms be trusted as objective sources when their creation is so subjective?

How can inclusivity become a leading principle of STEM?

How “human” can computers become?
</p>
 <h2> Week 9:</h2>
 <p> Both Olivia Ross' and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's contributions this week involve the importance of nuance and context in our lives as a way of reclaiming and owning the power we hold in speaking and creating, whether it be for ourselves or for others. While Ross urges digital creators to consider the multitude of elements that go into creating a project, involving the land and resources it utilizes, the people and ideas involved, and even the energy and ability used to create that project in an effort to create "nonviolent creative code", Adichie urges us to understand the importance of different stories, where we hear stories from, how we consume and create those stories and how they affect our world outlooks. In discussing nuance and detail as crucial resources in creating a more fair and conscious world in both the analog and the digital, we're encouraged to understand how power and power systems permeate through each aspect of society and how we may be complicit in that permeation, as well as the roles we can play in dismantling those power systems.
</br> </br>
Questions: 

In discussions of power within creation and storytelling, should we focus on redistributing power or dismantling power structures?

How does the language we use during the creation and storytelling process affect the perception of our subjects?

Just how specific can we get in the external and internal impacts of creation?
</p>
 <h2> Week 11:</h2>
 <p> Ari Melenciano's AFROTECTOPIA really spoke to me. The description of this project being made so that Black creators an designers could be able to create outside of a political or activist context spoke to me specifically, because as a Black aspiring creative I feel an immense pressure for my work to almost always have some deeper meaning, and wish to leave myself space to feel okay creating outside of a political context. The passion behind this project was also inspiring to me because of all the thought and research that went into creating a speculative future that benefits all. The discussion of technology being conventionally created to satisfy capitalist desires, as well as the typical pitfalls of design in sociological, ecological, economic etc. standpoints was all very encouraging, showing that designers like Melenciano can exist in a world where bias is so easily hidden to one's self but extremely obvious in what they produce. 
</br> </br>
Questions: 
How can de-centering humanity in design and creation lead to long-term benefits for all?
How can speculative futures affect the ways we see the world today and what can come of them?
Can creation and design truly be done without bias?</p>
 <h2> Week 12:</h2>
 <p> I found Christine Sun Kim's discussion on reclaiming sound and challenging those who hear aurally to engage in reforming social perceptions of Deaf culture to be extremely robust and encouraging. Discussing her relationship with sound and "sound etiquette", as well as needing to be hyperaware of sound as a Deaf person was enlightening to me, and shows how deep and normalized casual social inequalities can be on the basis of one's identity and ability. Kim's decision to be empowered by sound instead of dominated by it allowed us as the audience to consider sound outside the traditional auditory lens and invite other forms of sound into our lives, just as Kim has done. Using details in movement and hand placement to differentiate in visual sound aides in deconstructing the preconceived notions of what sound can be for both those who hear aurally and those who don't. </br> </br> Questions:
How do body language and intonation affect speech and communication?
How can we actively include visual forms of sound into our society?
How can we apply this inclusive thought to other disabilities and identities?
