        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <h2>Project 1: Interactive Audio & Visual with p5.js</h2>
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/wmadison/sketches/RRJCCX_qe">Final: Television</a>
        <p>For this project, I created an interactive television! You can surf through the channels of popular shows, and the ambience around the television will change with it! I tried to add more details to the background through using for loops, but the rest of the code wouldn't seem to work after the third for loop. There are also several media play errors, but all my videos play, so I assume it's okay? At least I hope so. I hope you enjoy the show(s)!</p>

        <h2>Project 2: HyperNarrative</h2>
        <a href="https://smile-for-the-camera-final.glitch.me">Final: Smile for the Camera</a>
        <p>This hypernarrative is all about me. I like to think of it as both a small photo album documentary of my life through various random photos, as well as my rather rocky relationship with photos and cameras and how I, being someone who hates being photographed or recorded, ironically fell in love with being on the other side of the camera. The journey of the story talks about the different types of pictures my family have taken of me and treasure, from baby photos, to pictures with fake smiles, to performance photos, to candid shots. As I explain the types of photos as well as the specific examples I use, I wanted the user to get a better understanding of my relationship with cameras.</p>

        <h2>Project 3: Networked Justice</h2>
        <a href="https://wramadison.github.io/iml300/project-3/index.html">Working at Profcorp Inc.:A Professionalism Translator</a>
        <p>This project is about workplace discrimination. The small journey the user takes as a new employee at PROFCORP INc., a majority-white company, discloses many of the typical forms of harrassment or discrimination that workers of various marginalized identites face in majority-white workspaces. The concept of workplace professionalism and workplace culture also typically masks this discriminatory behavior, and I highlighted that as well.</p>
