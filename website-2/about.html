    <h1> About</h1>
    <h3>The corporate workplace can be a cesspool for harrassment and discrimination under the guise of maintaining professionalism. </h3>
    <h3>Out of approximately 60,000 workplace complaints reported last year, 42% of them were tied to one's race or ethnicity. This doesn't account for those afraid to file complaints due to possible retaliation, the most common form of workplace harrassment.</h3>
    <h3> Discrimination via workplace "professionalism" looks like:
        <ul>
           <li>Microaggressive comments and actions</li>
            <li>Requiring tattoos or piercings to be covered</li>
            <li>Stringent and exclusive limitations on professional attire </li>
            <li>Use of exclusionary language and tones </li>
            <li>Prohibiting conversations on diversity, deeming them "too political"</li>
            <li>Directly or indirectly forcing POC employees to "speak White" or "speak proper English"</li>
            <li>Creating a predatory or biased "work culture"</li>
        </ul>
    </h3>
